JHTM

Implements some ideas from NuPIC in Java, with an eye toward high performance (colocated data, flyweight objects).

What has tests works, and the general design is sound.  I wrote this in the summer of 2013, with plans on getting back
to it, but haven't found the time.  Since NuPIC is now doing a Java implementation, I'm making this available under
a compatible license in case it is useful there (at least for inspiration).

License is GPL v3.
